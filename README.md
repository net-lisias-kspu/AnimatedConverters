## AnimatedConverters is a plugin for KSP mod development.
### It is a part of the [AT_Utils](https://github.com/allista/AT_Utils) framework.

It provides several part modules for resource conversion that use [MultiAnimators](https://github.com/allista/MultiAnimators) to animate the process. They are also mandatory-mass-conserving converters.

**This is a submodule. Do not checkout outside of AT_Utils or the project wil fail to build**
